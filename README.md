# NeatoTextBook20
This is the textbook for Mr. Neat's computer programming class for the year '19-'20

The textbook is made up of many folders.  Each folder contains at least a subfolder called "notes".  This folder has a pdf and ppt of the same material.  It contains lesson information and a lab designed to practice the lesson ideas.

There is also at least another subfolder called "labOutput".  This subfolder shows an example output for the assigned lab for that folder.

There may be other additional reference subfolders.

There is also a folder called "universal base code".  This folder is intended to be the starting point for any lab.  You may choose to use a previous lab's code as a starting point.
